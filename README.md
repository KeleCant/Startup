# Startup: What to Do

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been Bored? Have you ever wondered what should I do tonight but, had no ideas? With my new website "What to Do" you get access to beloved places in the area. You can see what's nearby. After visiting you can leave a comment to help other people have a fun night. If you discover a cool place you can add it, you never know maybe you will discover the next big hit.

### Design

![Mock](ModelDiagram.png)

This websight has 3 main pages:
    1st - There is the login Page
    2nd - There is The browing page which diplays nearby locations
    3rd - There is the adding location page which will grab your location or an adress and create a new page for that location.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Display of multiple locationsbased on distance and reviews
- Ability to comment and review places
- Ability to add new location

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic structural and organization of websight
- **CSS** - Styling and animating page changes
- **JavaScript** - Interactivity, switching pages and allowing you to click on buttons
- **Web Service** - Remote functions that pulls from data base of locations and reviews
- **Authentication** - Creating accounts and logging in
- **Database persistence** - Storing user data in a database - stores comments and reviews
- **WebSocket** - Will store the comments and upload them to server
- **Web Framework** - Using React to add components and request routing

## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - Four HTML pages for login, browsing, viewing, and adding.
- **Links** - switches page
- **Text** - comments will be displayed via text
- **Images** - This will show a picture of the location
