# Startup: Where to Go

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever spent the night in a city and wonerd what there is to do. The people who know this best are world travelers and Locals, with this websight you will be able to see local atractions. People can write comments and vote for them. List your city and see whats the most popular in your city. See what events are happening each night so theres always some place to check out. 

### Design

![Mock](ModelDiagram.png)

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how to people would interact with the backend to vote.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to select the question to decide
- Display of choices
- Ability to select, and change, top three choices
- Totals from all users displayed in realtime
- Ability for a user to lock in their top three
- Results are persistently stored
- Ability for admin to create and delete questions

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic structural and organizational elements
- **CSS** - Styling and animating
- **JavaScript** - Interactivity (e.g. What happens when a user presses a button)
- **Web Service** - Remote functions that your application calls on your, or someone else's, web server (e.g. saveScores, getWeather, chatWithFriend)
- **Authentication** - Creating accounts and logging in
- **Database persistence** - Storing user data in a database (e.g. Save the high scores and login information)
- **WebSocket** - Support for pushing data from the server. This can be peer to peer communication (e.g. chatting with friends through the browser), or realtime data from the server (e.g. stock prices or the current game leader)
- **Web Framework** - Using React to add components and request routing

## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - Two HTML page that represent the ability to login and vote.
- **Links** - The login page automatically links to the voter page. The voter page contains links for every voting choice.
- **Text** - Each of the voting choices is represented by a textual description.
- **Images** - I couldn't figure out how to include an image and so I didn't do this. ðŸ˜”
- **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The voting choices represent data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The count of voting results represent the tally of realtime votes.

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- **Header, footer, and main content body**
- **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts
- **Application images** - Still don't have images and so no styling here. ðŸ˜”

## JavaScript deliverable

For this deliverable I implemented by JavaScript so that the application works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the voting page.
- **database** - Displayed the voting counts. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
- **WebSocket** - I used the setInterval function to periodically increase a random vote count. This will be replaced with WebSocket messages later.
- **application logic** - The highlight and ranking number change based up the user's selections.

## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives votes and returns the voting totals.

- **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done!
- **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- **Calls to third party endpoints** - I didn't have time to implement this. ðŸ˜”
- **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server. Endpoints for voting.
- **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I did this using the fetch function.

## DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I associate the votes with the logged in user. I stored the votes in the database.

- **MongoDB Atlas database created** - done!
- **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!
- **User registration** - Creates a new account in the database.
- **existing user** - Stores the votes under the same user if the user already exists.
- **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores both user and their votes.
- **Restricts functionality** - You cannot vote until you have logged in. This is restricted on the frontend only. ðŸ˜”

## WebSocket deliverable

For this deliverable I used webSocket to update the votes on the frontend in realtime.

- **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - done!
- **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - done!
- **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - done!
- **WebSocket data displayed** - All user votes display in realtime. I'm really proud that this is working. Way cool!

## React deliverable

For this deliverable I converted the application over to use Vue. I know it is supposed to use React, but the instructor said I could use Vue because I already have extensive experience with React.

- **Bundled and transpiled** - done!
- **Components** - Login, voting list, vote are all components.
- **Router** - Routing between login and voting components.
- **Hooks** - Vue uses class properties instead of `UseState` to track changes in vote state.
